## About

Really simple library with pure vanilla javascript, no jQuery involved. It's just 1.0 kB minified and 0.4 kB gzipped.

- Supports accessability with aria attributes
- Supports options

1. The first time the user is visiting the page, the user will see a dialog box.
1. If the user click the accept button, the script that contains cookies will always be loaded from now on.
1. If the user click the cancel button, the script that contains cookies will never be loaded from now on.
1. On the next visit, no matter which button the visitor previously clicked on, the dialog box is not shown again.

To rememder the choice made by the user, local storage is used.

## Demos

## Setup

Instead of going step by step, I give you a full example.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>Eu Cookie Confirm</title>

    <link rel="stylesheet" href="assets/css/dist/style.css" />
  </head>
  <body>

    <!-- EU COOKIE CONFIRM HTML - Starts -->
    <div id="ecc" hidden>
      <div class="ecc-message">
        <h3>We use cookies</h3>
        <p>
          A short text <a href="#">about cookies</a>.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="ecc-buttonset">
        <button data-accept>Accept</button>
        <button data-cancel>Decline</a>
      </div>
    </div>
    <!-- EU COOKIE CONFIRM HTML - Ends -->

    <script src="assets/js/dist/script.js"></script>
    <script>
      let ecc = new euCookieConfirm();
      ecc.script(() => {
        console.log('Place your script here.');
      })
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

## Options

The function call below will not change anything compared to `euCookieConfirm()`, because every option is set to its default value.

```js
let new = euCookieConfirm({
  localStorageName: "eu-cookie-confirm",
  selectorAccept: "[data-accept]",
  selectorClose: "[data-cancel]",
  selectorMessage: "#ecc"
});
```

| Option             | Default               | Description                                                          |
| ------------------ | --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `localStorageName` | `"eu-cookie-confirm"` | The name that will be stored in the local storage.                   |
| `selectorAccept`   | `"[data-accept]"`     | The selector of the element that can be clicked to allow cookies.    |
| `selectorClose`    | `"[data-cancel]"`     | The selector of the element that can be clicked to disallow cookies. |
| `selectorMessage`  | `"#ecc"`              | The selector of the element box that contains the cookie question.   |
